try the simplest build

This app has no css, no images, no plugins, and two (2) lines of javascript.

It also has on "alert()" attached to the button.

If this does not work, you are having real problems.

When Cordova/Phonegap loads one line will change.
FROM: Cordova/Phonegap is **NOT** loaded.
TO:  Cordova/Phonegap is loaded.
